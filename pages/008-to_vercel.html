<p>Maintaining infrastructure by yourself is always a boring job, especially when it comes to https certificate related work and nginx configuration.</p>
<p>The original domain name of this site is _.0xffff.me, and I didn&#8217;t want to spend too much time on writing the front-end code, so I made it quickly with some very old unix tools and some shell script, I record them in this post <a href="https://me.0xffff.me/suckless.html">https:&#47;&#47;me.0xffff.me&#47;suckless.html</a>.</p>
<p>But after being mentioned more than once by friends about the lack of https and my weird domain name that didn&#8217;t resolve on Twitter, I finally made up my mind to embrace the modern world (well, my friend <a href="twitter.com/rauchg">@rauchg</a> also gave me the motivation).</p>
<p>I know Vercel has good support for the Next.js (and some other modern Web Frameworks) ecosystem, but I&#8217;m not sure if it supports such fully customizable and raw static sites. In the end, though, the jounrney turned out to be quite simple. </p>
<p>My goal: to learn as few new concepts as possible and get the job done (I don&#8217;t like reading docs&#8230;no one like)</p>
<p>After registering for a Vercel account, after signing up, it&#8217;s natural to notice that it implements the GitOps concept very well, and your work will revolve around your git repo, which is very nice and easy. I can do that.</p>
<p>Then, I directly put my repo URL into it, the automated build begins, Naturally, I didn&#8217;t have any hints to let Vercel know how my site was building, so the first build failed, but it&#8217;s good that the build log can clearly see what vercel is trying to do.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think Vercel&#8217;s Project Setting is a little bit hard to find, and it took me a long time to find a way to get Vercel to let me custom build step, but it was through Google: <a href="https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-add-a-custom-build-step-to-my-project">https:&#47;&#47;vercel.com&#47;guides&#47;how-can-i-add-a-custom-build-step-to-my-project</a></p>
<p>I noticed some custom scripts mentioned in this article, and I found a file called package.json to be important. This reminds me of npm. A very reasonable guess is that Vercel will run <code>npm run build</code> I can put my build script in package.json, this conjecture proved to be correct. But then when I found the project settings page, it all became clear.</p>
<p>The second challenge was to prepare the build environment. There were some minor roadblocks here, such as wget is not in the VM, but since there was a package manager, this didn&#8217;t block me for long.</p>
<p>What made me unhappy was that even if I made some small changes, I had to git push to the remote and then Vercel would start a new building. It was a pain not to have a debugging environment locally, especially for some complex build processes. This is not only a problem for Vercel, I had the same pain when using Github Action. </p>
<p>The third problem is where should the generated directoy be put for Vercel to render it? Like I said, I try to avoid reading the documentation. </p>
<p>This is something that Vercel does very well, outputting the clue in the build log directly after finishing the build</p>
<p><code>Error: No Output Directory named "public" found after the Build completed. You can configure the Output Directory in your Project Settings.</code></p>
<p>So it is a reasonable guess that Vercel will render the contents of the public&#47; folder (as long as it has index.html). My guess was right, and after I renamed the output directory from output&#47; to public&#47;, my site was up and running.</p>
<p>The journey that follows is the domain name, setting the domain name in Vercel is basically no-brainer, simply add a CNAME, https? not even a problem, I didn&#8217;t do anything, Vercel just correctly setup for my site.</p>
<p>Basically everything was done, I had set aside about 3 hours for the migration(Like I said, I&#8217;m not familiar with modern front-end development), but everything took me about 30min. During this process, I can feel Vercel&#8217;s focus on the development journey and make it as easy as possible, which is pretty good.</p>
<p>Next I&#8217;ll try to migrate some dynamic applications I&#8217;ve written to Vercel, as well as use TiDB Serverless for the backend storage (TiDB is an official Vercel partner and I&#8217;m proud of it), stay tuned!</p>
