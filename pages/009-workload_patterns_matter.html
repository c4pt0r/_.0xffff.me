Usually, when we look for commonalities, we use a top-down approach, such as classification based on industry/scenario, such as an online payment system for a bank, or an inventory management system for an e-commerce platform. However, for platform products (for example: databases system), just having top-down classification is not enough. For example, the technical architecture used in two different banks&#x27; payment systems may be completely different, or the same SQL workload may belong to completely different scenarios in different industries. This is normal.</p><p id="329986fa-3df0-4fec-a38d-dca4a963d790" class="">For platform product planning, not only top-down but also bottom-up approach is needed. Take a database product as an example:</p><ol type="1" id="18e40700-ca99-419c-b46a-3ca1f5e04e7e" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>What are the common SQL statements?</li></ol><ol type="1" id="5602c3a3-ed1e-422a-a7ed-64135fc6f8ce" class="numbered-list" start="2"><li>What are the common cluster topologies and scales?</li></ol><ol type="1" id="e01bcc35-59e6-4fd4-8afe-b2ccdd5876b3" class="numbered-list" start="3"><li>What are the common operation and maintenance methods? And cost?</li></ol><ol type="1" id="b1b527f5-b5e9-41b7-9d97-d631fd926a18" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li>What did users use to solve problems before using your product? Why should they use your product?</li></ol><p id="6678402d-0ffc-459f-b145-eb9b8e2b6fee" class="">Especially for database software, question 1 is crucial. Every product has its comfortable scenarios, and usually the SQL in these scenarios will have certain characteristics. Every product manager should ask themselves a core question: what did my feature contribute to this pattern (or limit it)?</p><p id="a7689994-4dec-4e19-8c92-4bd840f1c42c" class="">Why are Sysbench/TPC-C/TPC-H not enough? Simply put, business in the real world is more complicated, and it is difficult for developers to directly map business scenarios to standard benchmarks.</p><p id="b888976b-f633-4426-a1f4-aee369046093" class="">When you can summarize the features of your successful customer scenarios bottom-up, congratulations, you are not far from finding a replicable PMF, and these should be the directions your product roadmap should contribute to. The remaining work is to convert these patterns into top-down business value, so top-down is still necessary because you need to explain the value and increase confidence to the decision makers of your customers, which your marketing team understands.</p>
